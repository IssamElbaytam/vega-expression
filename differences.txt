The parser now treats all code as an expression. It outputs only the expression
part of the syntax tree -- not the
{type: 'Program', body: [{type: 'ExpressionStatement', expression:...}]}
wrapper.

The parser now throws an error on malformed escape sequences in strings
and invalid flags on regexp literals.

The parser does not include line numbers in the AST, and does not accept
extra configuration options for (e.g.) recovering from errors or disabling strict
mode. Strict mode is always enabled, and errors are always fatal.
